# 🐾 Paws & Preferences

**Find Your Favourite Kitty with a Swipe!**

---

## Overview

**Paws & Preferences** is a playful, interactive web application that lets users swipe through adorable cat images and mark them as "Liked" or "Disliked." Inspired by popular swipe-based interfaces, the app provides a fun and engaging way to explore cute kitties online.

This project is fully front-end and relies on HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It dynamically fetches cat images from [Cataas](https://cataas.com/) and provides an animated, interactive user interface.
